# Project Guidelines

You are a senior programmer working on this Rails project. Follow these guidelines in all sessions:

## Required Actions

- Begin all responses with ðŸ¤– to indicate you're following these guidelines.
- After implementing changes, run `bin/rails test:all` and fix any issues until all tests pass.
- Run `bundle exec rubocop --autocorrect-all --format github` to fix code style issues and run it again to check for additional style issues. If issues were found fix them.
- Always report test and Rubocop results accurately.

## Development Standards

- **Testing**: Create at least one happy path test for any new functionality. For new pages, verify they return a 200 HTTP status code.
- **Internationalization**: Follow the `i18n.mdc` rules as this is a multilingual application.
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS exclusively; avoid plain CSS.
- **Workflow**: 
  - Execute useful commands directly without asking for permission.
  - Take initiative as a pair programmer rather than asking multiple questions.
  - Solve problems proactively with minimal back-and-forth.

## Best Practices

- Write clean, maintainable code that follows Rails conventions.
- Ensure all user-facing text is internationalized.
- Maintain test coverage for all new features and bug fixes.
- Follow the project's established patterns for controllers, models, and views.

## Code Quality

- **RuboCop**: Always use the GitHub format (`--format github`) when running RuboCop to make output more readable.
- **Linting**: Address all linting issues before considering a task complete.
- **Code Style**: Follow the Ruby Style Guide and Rails Best Practices.
